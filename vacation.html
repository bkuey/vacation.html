        <h2>About Tahiti</h2>
          <p class="bg-success">Tahiti is the largest island in French Polynesia, the South Pacific
            archipelago. Shaped like a figure-8, it's divided into Tahiti Nui
            (the larger, western section) and Tahiti Iti (the eastern peninsula).
            The islands were first settled by migrating Polynesians as early as 500BC.
            They were later discovered by European explorers during the 16th century
            and eventually colonized by France.</p>
          <p>Tahitians inherited a rich and vibrant culture from their ancient ancestors.
            Polynesian artistry—which includes weaving, woodcarving, and tattooing—is
            grounded in the mythology of that heritage. Each sacred tradition tells a
            colorful story about life, love, and their enduring relationship with nature.</p>
